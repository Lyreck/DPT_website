# Our call for action

No AI without us: **No automation without consultation**. Join the fight to halt risky deployment and force real safeguards.

# 1. Sign the petition: stop risky AI
We refuse to let an opaque algorithm decide citizenship. Demand a moratorium until independent audits on bias, legality, and workload are public, plus a no job cuts guarantee for 10 years. Management announced rollout Oct 10 - consultation came too late. Add your voice now.

# 2. Demand oversight now
Call for full transparency: public impact reports, error statistics, demographic disparities yearly. Insist on an independent body (with union veto) over high-risk AI. Use our template to email Parliament and data protection authority.

# 3. Stand with applicants
Demand 100% human review on request, clear explanation, clear AI explanations, and non-digital options. No biases against migrants or vulnerable groups. Co-sign our public letter exposing citizen risk.

# 4. Take collective action
Ready for escalation? Join assemblies, work-to-rule (refuse unsafe AI use), protests. No crisis justifies this rush - we will strike if red lines break.
