# Position: 
Opportunistic, depending on what information could make headlines
## Interests:
Making sensational stories like “AI decides who becomes a citizen” and or “bias against migrants”, or on the contrary "The new political plan to enhance efficiency in citizenship application", "Waiting time decreased by 400%, a new promise from the government"
# Tensions: 
- Between the administration’s and political power's **desire for positive coverage** and the **risk of damaging image** and/or scandals
- Between **supporting citizens** or supporting the current **officials**
