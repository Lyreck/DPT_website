# Position
Mixed; some see potential for better decision-making, others warn of bias, opacity and long-term institutional change
## Interests:
- Conduct independent impact assessments and publish findings
- Ensure that the system is evaluated on real-world outcomes (fairness, error rates, impact on vulnerable groups), not just on speed and and “surface” use
## Tensions:
- Between the administration’s **desire for “positive” evaluations** and researchers’ need for **methodological independence**
- Between **short-term efficiency** metrics and **long-term risks** to rights of people
