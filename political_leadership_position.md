# Position 
Openly pro-deployment. Deploying AI solutions for effectiveness of public service is one of the main promises of the current Lydoria government. Pushes for the development of this technology without questioning the needs to support local start-ups and stimulate the digital economy and innovation ecosystem in the country. 
## Interests: 
- Deploy the technology to follow the guidelines from the current ruling party to secure political opportunities for the future 
- Optimize citizenship application speed to satisfy citizens and advertise it as a success for the next elections (2032) 
## Tensions:
- Between **Political Ambition** and **Legal/Operational Resistance**: The push for rapid deployment clashes with warnings from the legal department, ethics board, and IT teams about potential legal challenges, algorithmic biases, and technical vulnerabilities. 
- Between **Centralized Vision** and **Local issues**: The Ministry’s top-down approach to AI adoption ignores or minimizes concerns from trade unions, caseworkers, and civil society, who fear job losses, increased workloads, and unfair treatment of citizens. This resistance could slow implementation or lead to public backlash, undermining the project’s legitimacy
- Between **Supporting domestic innovation** and **depending on external actors**: The reliance on an external AI contractor for development and maintenance creates a tension between the government’s goal of supporting local start-ups and the reality of depending on outside expertise. This could spark criticism from domestic tech advocates and raise questions about sovereignty over critical public infrastructure
