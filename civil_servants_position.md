# Position 
Deeply skeptical and anxious; fear of losing skills, loss of professional autonomy, and increased workload.​
## Interests:
- Preserve their role as decision-makers and legal experts, not only be an “AI validator”​
- Avoid being held responsible for AI errors while having no control over the system’s logic
- Prevent hidden intensification of workload (more files, more complex cases, high demands without extra time).​
## Tensions:
- Between management’s promise of **“lighter routine work”** and workers’ **fear of being overloaded** with “hard cases” and blamed for delays
- Between the administration’s **goals of high AI adoption** and the reality of civil servants who could just **continue doing their job ignoring the risk score**.
