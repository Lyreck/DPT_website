# Our message to Minister Hardamain.

> HLC, 02-12-2025.

"This AI project is not about modernization - it’s about cutting corners and shifting risks onto workers and citizens. There is no evidence that this system will work as promised. What there is, is a threat to 12,000 jobs, to the quality of public service, and to the rights of people applying for citizenship.

We are not against technology, but we will not accept a system that puts civil servants and citizens on the side, overloads workers with extra work, and exposes them to blame for algorithmic failures. If our minister wants to talk about efficiency, let’s start by listening to the experts: the caseworkers who know this system inside out. No automation without consultation."
