# Position
Technically supportive but cautious; concerned about integration, data quality, and long-term maintenance
## Interests:
- Ensure system stability, data security, and compliance with internal IT standards​
- Avoid being blamed for technical failures or data leaks
- Maintain influence over how the system is configured and updated
## Tensions:
- Between **operational pressure** to deliver quickly/work more and **technical caution** about risks and dependencies on the external contractor.
- Between **IT department** and **civil servants** because they feel that updates are thrown onto them by IT department without taking them into consideration.
