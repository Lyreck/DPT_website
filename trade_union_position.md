# Position
Explicitly confrontational; opposes the deployment in its current form and possibly in general
## Interests:
- Protect jobs, working conditions, and professional autonomy of the caseworkers
- Ensure that AI supports decision-making rather than replace human judgment, especially for legal and ethical reasoning
- Start a genuine social dialogue that can shape the project, and not just approve it without any discussion 
## Tensions:
- Between **defensive, protective posture** and the need to propose **credible alternatives** (how to modernize without undermining rights and jobs?)
- Between **internal unity** (workers’ fears and distance from the tool) and **external credibility** (positioning as a responsible actor, not just an opponent of AI)
