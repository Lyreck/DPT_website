# Focus: 
Practical barriers for marginalized groups and specifically immigrants. 
# Concerns: 
The system may disadvantage applicants with irregular employment histories (common for immigrants that occupy more precarious jobs), limited formal education, or accents that NLP struggles to parse.
# Demands: 
Free legal support for applicants challenging AI-assisted rejections and a “human-first” appeals process.
