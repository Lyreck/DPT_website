# Focus: 
Algorithmic transparency and data privacy.
# Concerns:
The motivation letter analysis could penalize applicants for writing styles or cultural expressions, and the system’s opacity makes it impossible to audit for fairness.
# Demands:
Full disclosure of the algorithm’s training data and logic, and a moratorium on deployment until independent testing is completed.
